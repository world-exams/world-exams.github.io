### Explicación Pedagógica
**Correcta:** A. "The city's endurance and (its) beauty". Or "The walls... symbol of ... (their) beauty". Wait.
If "They (walls) stand as a symbol of the city's endurance and _____ beauty".
Is it the CITY'S beauty or the WALLS' beauty? "City's endurance" possesses "endurance". The logic implies "City's endurance and City's beauty". So "its".
If it referred to walls, it would be "their".
"The city" is singular inanimate -> **its**.
Let's look at the sentence again: "stand as a symbol of the city's endurance and (7) beauty."
The "and" connects "endurance" and "beauty". Both belong to "the city".
So "its" is the correct choice.

**Distractores:**
- B) "Their" would refer to walls, but the possessor "city's" governs the phrase.
- C) "Her" (Cities are sometimes female in poetry, but "its" is standard).
- D) Incorrect.
