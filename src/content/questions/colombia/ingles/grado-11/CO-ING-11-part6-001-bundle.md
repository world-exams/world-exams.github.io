# Pregunta Base: The Paramos - Colombia’s Water Factories

> **Contexto:** Read the text and answer the questions. The questions may require you to infer information not explicitly stated.

**Guardians of Water**

High in the Andes Mountains, above the forest line but below the snow caps, lies a unique ecosystem known as the **Páramo**. Colombia is home to approximately 50% of the world's páramos. Ideally located in cool and humid environments, these ecosystems are often described as "water factories" or "sponges."

Their main function is to capture moisture from the fog and rain. The vegetation, especially the iconic **frailejón** plants with their thick, soft leaves, absorbs this water and releases it slowly into the soil. This process creates streams and rivers that eventually supply water to major cities. In fact, it is estimated that 70% of the drinking water in Colombia comes from these high-altitude moors.

However, the páramos are fragile. Climate change, mining, and agriculture pose significant threats to their survival. If the temperature rises, the delicate balance of this ecosystem could be destroyed, affecting the water supply for millions of people. Protecting the páramos is not just about saving plants; it is about ensuring the future of the country.

Why are páramos compared to "sponges"?

### Opciones
- [x] A) Because they absorb water and release it slowly.
- [ ] B) Because they are soft and yellow like kitchen sponges.
- [ ] C) Because they are found underwater in the ocean.
- [ ] D) Because they are used to clean the mountains.

### Explicación Pedagógica
**Correcta:** A. The text says: "...vegetation... absorbs this water and releases it slowly... described as 'water factories' or 'sponges'."
