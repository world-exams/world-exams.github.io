# Pregunta Base: Colombia - A Paradise for Birds

> **Contexto:** Read the text and answer the questions. The questions may require you to infer information not explicitly stated.

**Wings Over the Andes**

Colombia holds a special title in the natural world: it is the country with the highest diversity of bird species on Earth. With over 1,950 registered species, it surpasses giants like Brazil and Peru. This incredible variety is due to Colombia's complex geography, which includes three Andean mountain ranges, two oceans, the Amazon rainforest, and vast plains.

In recent years, "avitourism" (birdwatching tourism) has become a growing industry. Enthusiasts travel thousands of miles to spot the majestic Andean Condor or the colorful multicolored tanager. This type of tourism does more than just bring money; it helps protect the environment. Local communities have learned that a live bird is worth more than a caged one, leading to increased efforts in conservation and reforestation.

However, challenges remain. Deforestation and illegal mining threaten the habitats of many endemic species. The future of Colombia's winged treasures depends on finding a balance between economic development and nature preservation.
