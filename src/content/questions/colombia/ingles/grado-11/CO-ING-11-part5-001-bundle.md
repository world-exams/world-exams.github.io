# Pregunta Base: The Flower Festival (Feria de las Flores)

> **Contexto:** Read the text and answer the questions based on it.

**The Flower Festival: A Bloom of Culture**

Medellín, known as the "City of Eternal Spring," hosts its most famous event, the **Feria de las Flores** (Flower Festival), every year in August. This tradition began in 1957 to celebrate the thriving flower industry of the region. The festival lasts for ten days and attracts tourists from all over the world.

The highlight of the festival is the **Desfile de Silleteros** (Silleteros Parade). Silleteros are local farmers from Santa Elena who carry large wooden frames called "silletas" on their backs. These frames are filled with colorful flowers arranged in beautiful designs. In the past, silletas were used to transport goods and even people up the steep mountains of Antioquia. Today, they are a symbol of hard work and cultural heritage.

Besides the parade, the festival includes the "Desfile de Autos Clásicos" (Classic Car Parade), concerts, and horse parades. It is not just a party; it is a tribute to the "paisa" culture and the region's biodiversity. Colombia is the second-largest exporter of flowers in the world, and this event showcases the variety of orchids, roses, and carnations that grow here.
