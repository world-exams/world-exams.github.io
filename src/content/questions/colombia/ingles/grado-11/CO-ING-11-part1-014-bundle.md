## Pregunta 6 (Difícil - Dificultad 5)

"If I were you" is often used to give advice. Therefore, "He advised me to..." is a more natural and accurate way to report this, although "He said that if he were me..." is also grammatically possible but less common as a direct translation of intent. Option A captures the function best.
