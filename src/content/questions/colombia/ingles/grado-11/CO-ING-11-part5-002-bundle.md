# Pregunta Base: Caño Cristales - The Liquid Rainbow

> **Contexto:** Read the text and answer the questions based on it.

**The River of Five Colors**

Hidden in the Serranía de la Macarena in Colombia, there is a river that looks like it belongs in a fairy tale. It is **Caño Cristales**, often called the "River of Five Colors" or the "Liquid Rainbow." For most of the year, it resembles a normal river, but between June and November, it transforms into a vibrant display of red, yellow, green, blue, and black.

The main reason for this magical coloration is a unique aquatic plant called *Macarenia clavigera*. This plant adheres to the river's rocky bed and turns a brilliant red when exposed to the right amount of sunlight and water level. Currently, the area is a protected national park. To preserve the delicate ecosystem, tourists must follow strict rules, such as not wearing sunscreen or insect repellent when swimming, as these chemicals can kill the plants.

Access to the river was restricted for many years due to armed conflict in the region. However, since 2009, it has been open to the public, becoming one of Colombia’s premier eco-tourism destinations.
