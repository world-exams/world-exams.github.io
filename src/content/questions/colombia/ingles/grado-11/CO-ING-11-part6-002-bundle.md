# Pregunta Base: The Walls Speak - Street Art in Bogotá

> **Contexto:** Read the text and answer the questions. The questions may require you to infer information not explicitly stated.

**More Than Vandalism**

For a long time, writing on walls was considered a crime in most cities. However, in Bogotá, the perception of graffiti has shifted dramatically over the last decade. Today, the Colombian capital is recognized as a global mecca for street art, attracting tourists and artists from all continents.

The turning point occurred in 2011, following a tragic incident involving a young graffiti artist and the police. This event sparked a city-wide debate about the use of public space. As a result, regulations were changed to decriminalize artistic expression on walls, provided the artists have the owner's permission.

Now, large murals cover buildings in the La Candelaria district and along 26th Street. These are not just random tags; they are complex works of art that tell stories of Colombia's indigenous roots, political struggles, and hopes for peace. The "Bogotá Graffiti Tour" serves as an educational platform, explaining the deep social messages hidden in the colorful spray paint.
